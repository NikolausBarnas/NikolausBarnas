## Hi there! I'm Nikolaus.  

### A bit about me

Welcome to my GitHub page! I love sharing my projects and
am always striving to improve my coding skills. 

I'm currently studying **Artificial Intelligence at JKU Linz**.

I am particularly excited about the intersection of AI and game development - specifically exploring how reinforcement learning can be applied to create challenging, 
adaptive agents for complex environments, especially strategically challenging board games.

### Featured Project: Doodle Ball

I am excited about working on **DoodleBall** with my friends, a 2D Physics Puzzle coming to Steam in 2026, where
you'll need to collect all items in a level by drawing using different kinds of pencils. :)

### What I'm working on

Apart from finishing up our first indie title, I'm focused on my studies. 
My personal projects are currently private as they slowly progress towards their MVPs. 
I'll definitely share them here once they are ready!
