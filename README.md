## Hi there! 

### A bit about me

I'm Nikolaus, welcome to my GitHub page. I love sharing my projects and
am always striving to improve my coding skills. 

While I'm studying Artificial Intelligence at JKU Linz I am excited
about working on DoodleBall with my friends, a 2D Physics Puzzle
coming to Steam in 2026.

### What I'm working on

Apart from DoodleBall, I'm keeping my personal prjects private at the moment.
I'll definetly share them when I have MVPs ready, for now they're slowly progressing towards that goal

I'm currently focused on studying and finishing developing my first indie title.
