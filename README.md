## Hi there! 

### A bit about me

I'm Nikolaus, welcome to my GitHub page. I love sharing my projects and
am always striving to improve my coding skills. 

While I'm studying Artificial Intelligence at JKU Linz I am excited
about working on DoodleBall with my friends, a 2D Physics Puzzle
coming to Steam in 2026.
